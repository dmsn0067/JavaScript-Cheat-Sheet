# JS Cheat Sheet and Reference Resource
A cheat sheet and reference resource for beginners to learn JS

This cheatsheet is a mini site which is designed to give a very basic yet detailed explanation of JS for front end development. The mathematics is left out for the most part, although there is a reference sheet for operators. This is made to bring you up to a level of understanding so you can read it, write it on your own and how to approach some basic things so that you don't feel lost as a beginner.

The cheatsheet can be viewed on the index.html page. However, you should view it on the cheatsheet.js file. This is so you can get used to reading code and code files in general.Â
